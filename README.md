# NBA_Pass_Diagram
A homework from my university data science course, practicing to draw diagrams from dataframes using Python plotly and networkx circular_layout.

As shown in the diagram, edges(passes) are thicker for edges with higher pass count, color ranging from blue to red reprsents pass quality based on the passed to players' total FGM/FGA compared with the FGM/FGA after this pass. Edges with less than 100 pass count are hidden so the diagram looks cleaner.
